COS_TRACON v3.5.sct2
by Noah Bryant

This file is meant to be used with VRC version 1.1

MVA altitudes have been added as static text. Used in conjunction with the MVA diagram they clearly show the minimum vectoring altitudes in the COS TRACON.

The COS Charlie airspace is a dark blue color to make it less distracting. The class C airspace floors and ceilings are added as static text as well.

I have also added a region depicting pikes peak at 11,500, 12,500 feet and 13,500 feet. Definitions of the colors are added as static text near the HBU vor.

Also added was airport graphics submitted by Erin Rakickas

See attached jpg image to see what the scope should look like.
